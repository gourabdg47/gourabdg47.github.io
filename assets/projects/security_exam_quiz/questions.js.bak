        "answer": "Something you know, something you are",
        "domain": "Multi-factor Authentication",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Something you know, something you are'. Authentication factors are categorized as something you know (e.g., password, PIN), something you have (e.g., smart card, phone), and something you are (e.g., fingerprint, facial scan). A PIN falls into the 'know' category, and a fingerprint falls into the 'are' category."

        "answer": "HIPS, Host-based firewall logs",
        "domain": "Hardening Techniques",
        "explanation": "The correct answers are A and D. Since the employee is using a cellular hotspot, the traffic is bypassing all network-based security controls (UTM, WAF, NGFW). The only place to find evidence of this traffic is on the endpoint itself. A HIPS (Host-based Intrusion Prevention System) and the logs from a host-based firewall could show network connections being made through an unexpected interface (the hotspot) to external destinations."
