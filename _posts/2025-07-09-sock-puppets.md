In Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), a "sock puppet" refers to a fictitious online identity or persona used by investigators to gather information without revealing their true identity. These fake accounts allow OSINT practitioners to blend into online communities, access restricted groups, and gather intelligence that might otherwise be inaccessible.

The main purposes of using sock puppets in OSINT include:

- **Anonymity:** Protecting the investigator's real identity and personal safety.
- **Access to Restricted Information:** Gaining entry to private groups or forums where the target might be active.
- **Operational Security (OpSec):** Separating personal online activity from professional investigations.
- **Social Engineering:** Engaging with targets to gather more in-depth information beyond publicly available data.

Creating effective sock puppets requires careful planning and attention to detail to maintain credibility and avoid detection. This often involves:

- Developing a realistic persona with a name, age, gender, and a credible social history.
- Using dedicated email addresses and phone numbers (often "burner" phones) that cannot be traced back to the investigator.
- Employing tools like VPNs, Tor, or public Wi-Fi to mask the true IP address.
- Generating realistic profile pictures using AI tools.
- Engaging in "normal" online activity to make the persona appear authentic to platforms and other users.
    
While sock puppets can be powerful tools for OSINT, their use also involves ethical considerations and potential legal risks that investigators must weigh.
