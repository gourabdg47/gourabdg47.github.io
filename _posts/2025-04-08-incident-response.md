# **Incident Response**
Outlines a structured approach to  **<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Manage</span>** and **<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Mitigate</span>** security incidents effectively
##### Goals:
1. **Minimize Impact**
2. **Reduce response Time**
3. **Hasten (Fast)  Recovery**
	- *Incident Detection & Classification*
	- *Evidence Preservation*
	- *Communication & Reporting*
	- *Lessons Learned* 

#### Incident response process
__Incident__: Act of violating an explicit or implied security policy
###### Seven (7) Phase Model
1. **Preparation**: Policies & Procedures are written. Getting ready for future incidents
2. **Detection**: If a security incident has occurred and assessing the potential incident severity. The incident is categorized and triaged 
3. **Analysis**: The incident is thoroughly examined & evaluated. Understand the scope & impact of the incident, evaluate the nature & potential consequences. 
4. **Containment**: Limit the scope and magnitude of the incident by securing the data and minimize the impact on business operations.
5. **Eradication**: Focused on removing the malicious activity from a given system or network.
6. **Recovery**: Focused on restoring the effective system and services to there normal secure state.
	- *Restoring from known good backup*
	- *Installing security patches*
	- *Implementing configuration updates* 
7. **Post-incident activity / Lessons Learned**: Analysis the incident and the response to identify whether the procedures and systems that we had worked properly or anything else we can do better next time. 
		**Actions**: 
		*1. Root cause analysis*: Identify the source of the incident and how to prevent it in future
			**- Define/Scope the incident** 
			**- Determine the casual relationships that led to the incident** 
			**- Identify an effective solution**
			**- Implement & track the solutions**
		*2. Lessons learned process*: What went right, what went wrong & what can we do better next time.
		*3. After-action report*: Formalized report that collects information about what happened. Should have the '**Root cause analysis** & **Recommendation for improvements**'

#### Threat Hunting
Method for finding hidden threats not caught by regular security monitoring. This is  the act of being proactive in your defense as opposed to being reactive like you are with incident response. We are looking for threats within our network instead of waiting for them to attack us.
1. **Establish a Hypothesis**: Predicting high-impact, likely events through threat modeling and which events have the highest likelihood if there where to occur. 
	- *Who might want to harm us ?*
	- *Who might want to break into our networks ?*
	- *How might they be able to do that ?*
2. **Profiling Threat Actors and Activities**: Creating scenarios that shows how a perspective attacker might attempt an intrusion and what there objectives might be 
	- *What TTPs (**Tactics, Techniques & Procedures**) might they use ?*
	- Who wants to harm us ?
	- *Are they insider threat, a hacktivist, a criminal organization or a nation-state APT ?*

#### Root Cause Analysis
A systematic process to identify the initial source of the incident and how to prevent if from occurring again.
1. **Define the scope of the incident** 
2. **Determine the casual relationships** 
3. **Identify  an effective solution**
4. **Implement & track the solution**

## Case Study: MedSecure Hospital Incident Response

### Introduction

MedSecure Hospital, a mid-sized healthcare institution handling sensitive patient records and critical operational systems, experienced a cyber incident that threatened patient care, data security, and regulatory compliance. In this case study, we examine how MedSecure Hospital applied a seven‐phase incident response model to quickly detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, and recover from a ransomware attack, followed by a thorough post‐incident review. The process not only minimized downtime but also strengthened the organization’s overall security posture.

### Background

MedSecure Hospital had implemented a robust cybersecurity program with a dedicated Incident Response Team (IRT). The organization had established regular security awareness training, maintained updated digital forensic tools, and ran continuous network monitoring through a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform. Despite these preparations, advanced threat actors managed to exploit an unpatched vulnerability in a legacy imaging system, launching a ransomware attack that began encrypting several departmental servers.

### Incident Timeline

- **Day 0: Preparation**  
    MedSecure Hospital's IT security policies and protocols were reviewed quarterly, and regular training exercises were conducted. A detailed incident response plan was in place, which included defined roles, communication hierarchies, and established backup routines.
    
- **Day 1: Detection**  
    An alert was triggered by the SIEM, indicating unusual network traffic and a spike in file-access operations on the imaging department’s server. An on-duty technician also noted that several workstations were sluggish and showing error messages.
    
- **Day 1: Analysis**  
    The Incident Response Team immediately convened to analyze logs, verify alerts, and isolate affected endpoints. Forensic software was used to determine that ransomware had infiltrated and begun encrypting critical files. Incident categorization confirmed a high-severity breach with potential impacts on patient care and data privacy.
    
- **Day 1: Containment**  
    The team isolated affected servers by segmenting the network and disabling external communications from compromised systems. Remote access to non-affected systems was temporarily curtailed to prevent lateral movement of the malware.
    
- **Day 2: Eradication**  
    With containment in place, the team worked to remove the ransomware. The eradication process involved deploying patches to the legacy imaging system, removing malicious software from infected servers, and revoking compromised credentials.
    
- **Day 3: Recovery**  
    The recovery phase began by restoring data from verified backups and reimaging the affected servers. Systems were incrementally reconnected to the network under strict monitoring, ensuring that no remnants of the attack persisted.
    
- **Day 4 & Beyond: Post‐Incident Activity**  
    A comprehensive lessons learned meeting was held with all stakeholders. The review documented the incident timeline, response effectiveness, and communication efficacy. The hospital updated its patch management policies, improved training for staff regarding phishing and suspicious network behavior, and revised its incident response plan.
