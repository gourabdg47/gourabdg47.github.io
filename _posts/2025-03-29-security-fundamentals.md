## Fundamentals of Security

- Three pillars of security : CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability)
	- **Confidentiality :** Information only accessed to those with the appropriate authorization.
		- Encryption
		- Access Controls
		- Data Masking
		- Physical Security Measures
		- Training & Awareness
	- **Integrity :** Data remains accurate and unaltered unless modification is required
		- Hashing
		- Digital Signatures
		- Checksums
		- Access Controls
		- Regular Audits
	- **Availability :** Ensure information and resources are accessible and functional when needed by authorized users 
		- Redundancy : Duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of enhancing its reliability
			1. Server Redundancy
			2. Data Redundancy
			3. Network Redundancy
			4. Power Redundancy
- Non-Repudiation : Guaranteeing that a specific action or event has taken place and can not be denied by the other party involved
- AAA of Security : 
	- **Authentication :** Process of verifying the identity of a user or system
	- **Authorization :** Define what action or resources a user can access (maintain system integrity). Rules & Policies 
	- **Accounting :** Act of tracking user activity and resource usage mainly for audit and billing purpose
		- Transparency 
		- Security 
		- Accountability 
		
		* Accounting System : Audit trail, Regulatory Compliance, Forensic Analysis, Resource Optimization, User Accountability 
		* Tech can be used : 
			1. Syslog servers
			2. Network analysis tools
			3. SIEMs
- **Security Controls :** Measures put in place to protect confidentiality, integrity & availability of information system and data
	- Security Categories : 
		1. Technical
		2. Managerial
		3. Operational
		4. Physical
	- Security Types : 
		1. Preventive 
		2. Detective
		3. Compensating
		4. Deterrent
		5. Corrective
		6. Directive

- **Zero Trust :** Zero Trust is not just another security buzzword—it's a paradigm shift that challenges the traditional "trust but verify" mindset. Instead of assuming that anyone inside your network is inherently trustworthy, Zero Trust flips the script: **never trust, always verify**. This means that whether a user or device is inside or outside your organization’s network, every access attempt must be authenticated, authorized, and continuously monitored.
	### *The Two Essential Planes of Zero Trust*
	Zero Trust architecture can be divided into two primary components:
	
	#### 1. **Control Plane**
	
	Think of the control plane as the brain of your security system. It’s where all the magic happens—from defining policies to making real-time decisions on who gets access. Here’s what it does:
	
	- **Policy Management:** The control plane establishes and manages the security policies that dictate who or what is allowed to access your resources. It takes into account contextual data like user roles, device security posture, location, and time of access.
	    
	- **Identity Verification:** Every access request goes through rigorous identity checks. The control plane integrates with authentication systems (like multi-factor authentication or SSO) to confirm that users are who they claim to be.
	    
	- **Centralized Decision-Making:** When a request comes in, the control plane quickly evaluates it against the established policies. It decides whether the request should be permitted, flagged for additional scrutiny, or denied outright.
	    
	- **Dynamic Adaptation:** The control plane isn’t static. It continuously learns from ongoing traffic and can adapt policies in real time to mitigate emerging threats or respond to unusual behavior.
	    
	
	#### 2. **Data Plane**
	
	If the control plane is the brain, then the data plane is the nervous system that actually carries  out the actions. It’s responsible for:
	
	- **Traffic Management:** The data plane handles the flow of information. It routes data packets between users and resources, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized requests get through.
	    
	- **Policy Enforcement:** Once the control plane makes a decision, the data plane enforces it. For example, if access is denied, the data plane stops the data packets from reaching their destination.
	    
	- **Real-Time Monitoring:** It continuously monitors data flow for any signs of abnormal activity. This immediate, on-the-fly analysis is crucial for detecting breaches or potential threats as they happen.
	    
	- **Scalability:** The data plane is designed to manage large volumes of traffic efficiently, making sure that security measures don’t bottleneck your network performance.
	
* Non-repudiation : Undeniable proof in the world in digital transactions (Digital Signatures)
	* Confirming the authenticity of digital transactions 
	* Ensuring Integrity
	* Providing Accountability
