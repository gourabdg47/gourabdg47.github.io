Well as I was studying about phishing analysis, there techniques and was starting "Email Analysis Methodology" I realized that ... well f**k it, I am gonna watch some movies. I opened a site that I came across long time back but never got the time to look into it. This site host free movies that we can watch online. Since it's a pirated site, I won't be naming it here [n--u.to](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https://preview.redd.it/qnjwm6dgvlq91.jpg?width%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc6013a7e3f87a9292de3cb667fa3f328fdac2757). 
Anyways I am planning to watch *Thunderbolts 2025* and maybe talk about it. 

This movie is based on _Marvel world_, so as the movie begins like as all of us do, the protagonist (maybe) is wondering about the purpose of life. She feels numb and dull and bored. She is into clean-up business, just the regular stuff - kill few people, steal something valuable, etc 

Ok, came out that the site doesn't work so well, takes forever to buffer randomly. Finding another source ...
