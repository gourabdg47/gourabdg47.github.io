# Governance & Compliance
Overall management of the Organization's IT infrastructure, policies, procedures and operations

## Governance
Strategic leadership, structures and procedures that ensure an organization's IT infrastructure aligns with its business objectives.
*This framework includes the rules, responsibilities and practices that guide an organization in achieving it's goals and managing its IT resources*

#### Governance Structures

Governance structures are the frameworks that define how decisions are made, authority is distributed, and accountability is maintained within an organization. Below is a breakdown of key governance structures, their roles, requirements, and how governance principles apply.

---
##### **Boards**

- **Definition**: A board of directors (or governing board) is a group of elected or appointed individuals responsible for overseeing an organization’s strategic direction, performance, and accountability.
    
- **Roles**:
    
    - Set long-term goals and approve major policies.
    - Ensure alignment with stakeholder interests (e.g., shareholders, employees, customers).
    - Monitor risk management and financial integrity.
    - Hire, evaluate, and compensate executive leadership (e.g., CEO).
        
- **Requirements**:
    
    - Diverse expertise (legal, financial, industry-specific).
    - Independence to avoid conflicts of interest.
    - Regular meetings and access to accurate organizational data.
        
- **Governance Link**: Boards embody governance by enforcing ethical standards, regulatory compliance, and transparency. They act as the ultimate decision-making authority, balancing stakeholder needs with organizational sustainability.
    

---
##### **Committees**

- **Definition**: Subgroups of the board or organization focused on specific areas (e.g., audit, compensation, risk).
    
- **Roles**:
    
    - Deep-dive into specialized topics (e.g., financial audits, executive pay).
    - Provide recommendations to the full board or leadership.
    - Monitor compliance with policies (e.g., ESG commitments).
        
- **Requirements**:
    
    - Members with relevant expertise (e.g., finance for audit committees).
    - Clear mandates and reporting lines to the board.
    - Regular reviews of committee effectiveness.
        
- **Governance Link**: Committees decentralize oversight, enabling detailed governance in critical areas. They ensure no single board member bears full responsibility for complex issues.
    

---
##### **Government Entities**

- **Definition**: External regulatory or oversight bodies (e.g., SEC, central banks, industry regulators).
    
- **Roles**:
    
    - Enforce laws and regulations (e.g., data privacy, financial reporting).
    - Protect public interest (e.g., consumer rights, environmental standards).
    - Impose penalties for non-compliance.
        
- **Requirements**:
    
    - Organizations must stay informed about regulatory changes.
    - Invest in compliance infrastructure (e.g., reporting systems).
    - Engage in lobbying or advocacy where relevant.
        
- **Governance Link**: Government entities shape external governance expectations. Organizations must align internal governance practices with legal requirements to avoid fines, reputational damage, or operational restrictions.
    

---
##### **Centralized Structures**

- **Definition**: A hierarchy where decision-making authority rests with a single leader or small group (e.g., CEO, executive team). Top-down
    
- **Roles**:
    
    - Ensure consistency in strategy and operations.
    - Streamline communication and reduce redundancies.
    - Maintain tight control over risks.
        
- **Requirements**:
    
    - Strong leadership with broad organizational visibility.
    - Clear delegation of tasks without diluting authority.
    - Efficient reporting mechanisms.
        
- **Governance Link**: Centralized structures simplify governance by concentrating accountability. However, over-centralization can stifle innovation and create bottlenecks.
    

---
##### **Decentralized Structures**

- **Definition**: Authority distributed across teams, departments, or regions (e.g., subsidiaries, autonomous units). Bottom-up
    
- **Roles**:
    
    - Empower local decision-making for agility.
    - Foster innovation and responsiveness to market changes.
    - Reduce dependency on top-tier leadership.
        
- **Requirements**:
    
    - Robust communication channels to align decentralized units.
    - Clear boundaries for decision-making autonomy.
    - Performance metrics to ensure accountability.
        
- **Governance Link**: Decentralization requires strong governance frameworks to prevent fragmentation. Policies like standardized reporting and ethical guidelines ensure cohesion despite dispersed authority.

### How Governance Ties It All Together

Effective governance harmonizes these structures by:

1. **Clarifying Roles**: Defining boundaries between boards, committees, and leadership.
2. **Balancing Control**: Blending centralized oversight with decentralized agility.
3. **Ensuring Compliance**: Aligning internal practices with external regulations.
4. **Promoting Accountability**: Using structures to track performance and ethical behavior.

By integrating these elements, organizations can build resilient, adaptive, and ethical governance systems.

---
### Policies
**Policies** are formal, high-level documents that outline an organization’s rules, standards, and procedures to achieve specific goals (e.g., security, compliance, operational efficiency). They define _what_ must be done, while **procedures** explain _how_ to implement them.

#### 1. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

- **Definition**: A set of rules outlining how an organization’s systems, networks, and data may be used by employees, contractors, or third parties.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A company requires employees to sign an AUP before accessing corporate email. The policy prohibits using email for personal marketing, sharing sensitive data externally, or visiting malicious websites. Violations could result in revoked access or disciplinary action.
        

---
#### 2. Information Security Policy

- **Definition**: A comprehensive document defining how an organization protects its data, systems, and infrastructure from threats. It aligns with standards like ISO 27001 or NIST.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A hospital implements an Information Security Policy to safeguard patient health records (PHI). The policy mandates encryption for data at rest, multi-factor authentication (MFA) for system access, and regular vulnerability scans to comply with HIPAA regulations.
        

---
#### 3. Business Continuity Policy (BCP)

- **Definition**: A plan to ensure critical business functions continue during and after a disruption (e.g., natural disasters, cyberattacks).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A retail chain’s BCP ensures operations continue during a regional power outage. The policy includes shifting to cloud-based inventory systems, rerouting customer service calls to unaffected regions, and contracting alternate suppliers to avoid revenue loss.
        

---
#### 4. Disaster Recovery Policy (DRP)

- **Definition**: A subset of BCP focused on restoring IT systems, data, and infrastructure after a catastrophic event.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A financial institution’s DRP outlines steps to recover from a ransomware attack. This includes restoring data from offsite backups, activating failover servers in a secondary data center, and meeting a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours to resume transactions.
        

---
#### 5. Incident Response Policy (IRP)

- **Definition**: A structured approach for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents (e.g., breaches, malware).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A tech company’s IRP is triggered when unusual network traffic indicates a potential data exfiltration. The policy guides the team to isolate infected systems, preserve logs for forensic analysis, notify affected customers under GDPR, and patch vulnerabilities to prevent recurrence.
        

---
#### 6. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Policy

- **Definition**: A framework for integrating security into every phase of software development (design, coding, testing, deployment).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A fintech startup’s SDLC policy mandates code reviews, static/dynamic analysis tools, and penetration testing before releasing a mobile banking app. This prevents vulnerabilities like SQL injection (listed in OWASP Top 10) from reaching production.
        

---
#### 7. Change Management Policy

- **Definition**: A process to ensure changes to IT systems (e.g., updates, patches) are tested, approved, and documented to minimize risks.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - An e-commerce platform uses a Change Management Policy to roll out a critical security patch. Changes are tested in a staging environment, approved by a Change Advisory Board (CAB), and deployed during off-peak hours with a rollback plan in case of failures.


---
### Standards
Provide a framework for implementing security measures, ensuring that all aspects of an organization's security posture are addressed.
#### 1. Password Standards

- **Definition**: Rules defining requirements for creating, managing, and protecting passwords (e.g., complexity, length, expiration, reuse).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A company enforces password standards requiring employees to use 12-character passwords with a mix of uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords expire every 90 days, and reuse of the last five passwords is blocked. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandated for remote access.
        
    - **Relevance**: Mitigates brute-force attacks and credential stuffing (Domain: Identity and Access Management).
        

---

#### 2. Access Control Standards

- **Definition**: Guidelines for granting, managing, and revoking access to systems, data, or facilities (e.g., role-based access control (RBAC), least privilege).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A hospital uses RBAC standards to ensure nurses can only access patient records in their department, while doctors have broader access. Temporary access is granted to contractors for specific projects and revoked afterward.
        
    - **Relevance**: Aligns with the principle of least privilege and prevents unauthorized access (Domain: Identity and Access Management).
        

---

#### 3. Physical Security Standards

- **Definition**: Protocols to protect physical assets (e.g., servers, offices, devices) from theft, tampering, or environmental hazards.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A data center implements physical security standards such as biometric scanners for entry, CCTV surveillance, and locked server racks. Environmental controls (e.g., fire suppression, cooling systems) are maintained to prevent hardware damage.
        
    - **Relevance**: Addresses threats like theft, tailgating, and environmental risks (Domain: Architecture and Design).
        

---

#### 4. Encryption Standards

- **Definition**: Specifications for encrypting data at rest, in transit, and in use (e.g., AES-256 for data, TLS 1.3 for communications).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A financial institution encrypts all customer transactions using TLS 1.3 to protect data in transit. Credit card details stored in databases are encrypted with AES-256, and keys are managed via a hardware security module (HSM).
        
    - **Relevance**: Ensures confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data (Domain: Cryptography).

---
### Procedures
They are the lifeblood of any organization. It is a systematic sequence of actions or steps taken to achieve a specific outcome.
OR
Procedures are **step-by-step instructions** that operationalize policies and standards. They define _how_ to perform specific tasks securely and consistently, ensuring compliance with organizational and regulatory requirements.

#### **Key Characteristics**:

- **Actionable**: Provide clear, repeatable steps.
- **Detailed**: Leave little room for ambiguity.
- **Accountable**: Assign roles (e.g., IT staff, incident responders).
    

---
Below are some common procedures:

##### 1. Incident Response Procedures

- **Definition**: Steps to detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - _Phishing Attack_: Employees follow a procedure to report suspicious emails to the SOC. The SOC then isolates affected devices, analyzes the email headers, removes malicious links, and patches vulnerabilities.
        
##### 2. Backup and Recovery Procedures

- **Definition**: Steps to create, store, and restore data backups.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - _Ransomware Attack_: IT staff follow a procedure to restore encrypted files from offline backups stored in a geographically separate location, ensuring minimal downtime.
        
##### 3. Access Control Provisioning

- **Definition**: Steps to grant, modify, or revoke system access (e.g., onboarding/offboarding employees).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - _Employee Onboarding_: HR triggers a workflow to create a user account with role-based access (RBAC), ensuring the new hire only accesses resources needed for their job.
        
##### 4. Patch Management Procedures

- **Definition**: Steps to test, approve, and deploy software updates.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - _Critical Vulnerability_: IT teams use automated tools to deploy patches to all endpoints after testing in a sandbox environment, with a rollback plan if issues arise.
        
##### 5. Physical Security Checks

- **Definition**: Steps to inspect facilities for vulnerabilities (e.g., unauthorized access, environmental risks).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - _Data Center Audit_: Guards follow a nightly procedure to log entries/exits, check CCTV feeds, and verify server room door locks.
        
##### 6. Password Reset Procedures

- **Definition**: Steps to securely reset compromised or forgotten passwords.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - _User Lockout_: Help desk verifies identity via MFA and a security question before resetting the password and enforcing a temporary 24-hour password.
        
##### 7. Risk Assessment Procedures

- **Definition**: Steps to identify, analyze, and prioritize risks (e.g., vulnerability scans, penetration testing).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - _Third-Party Vendor Risk_: A bank conducts annual vulnerability scans on vendor systems and reviews compliance with contractual SLAs.

#### Playbooks
A **playbook** is a predefined, step-by-step guide that outlines how to detect, respond to, and recover from specific security incidents or operational scenarios. Playbooks standardize responses to ensure consistency, efficiency, and compliance with organizational policies and regulatory frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001).
##### Key Components of a Playbook

1. **Objective**: The goal of the playbook (e.g., "Respond to a ransomware attack").
2. **Roles & Responsibilities**: Who does what (e.g., SOC analysts, IT teams, legal/compliance).
3. **Detection Steps**: How to identify the incident (e.g., alerts from SIEM, user reports).
4. **Containment Actions**: Isolate affected systems to prevent spread (e.g., disconnect from the network).
5. **Eradication Steps**: Remove threats (e.g., delete malware, patch vulnerabilities).
6. **Recovery Procedures**: Restore systems and data (e.g., use backups, validate integrity).
7. **Communication Plans**: Notify stakeholders (e.g., executives, customers, regulators).
8. **Post-Incident Review**: Document lessons learned and update defenses.
