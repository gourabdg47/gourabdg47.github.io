I am following [Jason Dion's Security+ course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/learn/lecture/40324620#overview) to prepare for the CompTIA Security+ certification.

# Governance & Compliance
Overall management of the Organization's IT infrastructure, policies, procedures and operations

## Governance
Strategic leadership, structures and procedures that ensure an organization's IT infrastructure aligns with its business objectives.
*This framework includes the rules, responsibilities and practices that guide an organization in achieving it's goals and managing its IT resources*

#### Governance Structures

Governance structures are the frameworks that define how decisions are made, authority is distributed, and accountability is maintained within an organization. Below is a breakdown of key governance structures, their roles, requirements, and how governance principles apply.

---
##### **Boards**

- **Definition**: A board of directors (or governing board) is a group of elected or appointed individuals responsible for overseeing an organization’s strategic direction, performance, and accountability.
    
- **Roles**:
    
    - Set long-term goals and approve major policies.
    - Ensure alignment with stakeholder interests (e.g., shareholders, employees, customers).
    - Monitor risk management and financial integrity.
    - Hire, evaluate, and compensate executive leadership (e.g., CEO).
        
- **Requirements**:
    
    - Diverse expertise (legal, financial, industry-specific).
    - Independence to avoid conflicts of interest.
    - Regular meetings and access to accurate organizational data.
        
- **Governance Link**: Boards embody governance by enforcing ethical standards, regulatory compliance, and transparency. They act as the ultimate decision-making authority, balancing stakeholder needs with organizational sustainability.
    

---
##### **Committees**

- **Definition**: Subgroups of the board or organization focused on specific areas (e.g., audit, compensation, risk).
    
- **Roles**:
    
    - Deep-dive into specialized topics (e.g., financial audits, executive pay).
    - Provide recommendations to the full board or leadership.
    - Monitor compliance with policies (e.g., ESG commitments).
        
- **Requirements**:
    
    - Members with relevant expertise (e.g., finance for audit committees).
    - Clear mandates and reporting lines to the board.
    - Regular reviews of committee effectiveness.
        
- **Governance Link**: Committees decentralize oversight, enabling detailed governance in critical areas. They ensure no single board member bears full responsibility for complex issues.
    

---
##### **Government Entities**

- **Definition**: External regulatory or oversight bodies (e.g., SEC, central banks, industry regulators).
    
- **Roles**:
    
    - Enforce laws and regulations (e.g., data privacy, financial reporting).
    - Protect public interest (e.g., consumer rights, environmental standards).
    - Impose penalties for non-compliance.
        
- **Requirements**:
    
    - Organizations must stay informed about regulatory changes.
    - Invest in compliance infrastructure (e.g., reporting systems).
    - Engage in lobbying or advocacy where relevant.
        
- **Governance Link**: Government entities shape external governance expectations. Organizations must align internal governance practices with legal requirements to avoid fines, reputational damage, or operational restrictions.
    

---
##### **Centralized Structures**

- **Definition**: A hierarchy where decision-making authority rests with a single leader or small group (e.g., CEO, executive team).
    
- **Roles**:
    
    - Ensure consistency in strategy and operations.
    - Streamline communication and reduce redundancies.
    - Maintain tight control over risks.
        
- **Requirements**:
    
    - Strong leadership with broad organizational visibility.
    - Clear delegation of tasks without diluting authority.
    - Efficient reporting mechanisms.
        
- **Governance Link**: Centralized structures simplify governance by concentrating accountability. However, over-centralization can stifle innovation and create bottlenecks.
    

---
##### **Decentralized Structures**

- **Definition**: Authority distributed across teams, departments, or regions (e.g., subsidiaries, autonomous units).
    
- **Roles**:
    
    - Empower local decision-making for agility.
    - Foster innovation and responsiveness to market changes.
    - Reduce dependency on top-tier leadership.
        
- **Requirements**:
    
    - Robust communication channels to align decentralized units.
    - Clear boundaries for decision-making autonomy.
    - Performance metrics to ensure accountability.
        
- **Governance Link**: Decentralization requires strong governance frameworks to prevent fragmentation. Policies like standardized reporting and ethical guidelines ensure cohesion despite dispersed authority.

### How Governance Ties It All Together

Effective governance harmonizes these structures by:

1. **Clarifying Roles**: Defining boundaries between boards, committees, and leadership.
2. **Balancing Control**: Blending centralized oversight with decentralized agility.
3. **Ensuring Compliance**: Aligning internal practices with external regulations.
4. **Promoting Accountability**: Using structures to track performance and ethical behavior.

By integrating these elements, organizations can build resilient, adaptive, and ethical governance systems.

### Policies
**Policies** are formal, high-level documents that outline an organization’s rules, standards, and procedures to achieve specific goals (e.g., security, compliance, operational efficiency). They define _what_ must be done, while **procedures** explain _how_ to implement them.

#### 1. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

- **Definition**: A set of rules outlining how an organization’s systems, networks, and data may be used by employees, contractors, or third parties.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A company requires employees to sign an AUP before accessing corporate email. The policy prohibits using email for personal marketing, sharing sensitive data externally, or visiting malicious websites. Violations could result in revoked access or disciplinary action.
        

---
#### 2. Information Security Policy

- **Definition**: A comprehensive document defining how an organization protects its data, systems, and infrastructure from threats. It aligns with standards like ISO 27001 or NIST.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A hospital implements an Information Security Policy to safeguard patient health records (PHI). The policy mandates encryption for data at rest, multi-factor authentication (MFA) for system access, and regular vulnerability scans to comply with HIPAA regulations.
        

---
#### 3. Business Continuity Policy (BCP)

- **Definition**: A plan to ensure critical business functions continue during and after a disruption (e.g., natural disasters, cyberattacks).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A retail chain’s BCP ensures operations continue during a regional power outage. The policy includes shifting to cloud-based inventory systems, rerouting customer service calls to unaffected regions, and contracting alternate suppliers to avoid revenue loss.
        

---
#### 4. Disaster Recovery Policy (DRP)

- **Definition**: A subset of BCP focused on restoring IT systems, data, and infrastructure after a catastrophic event.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A financial institution’s DRP outlines steps to recover from a ransomware attack. This includes restoring data from offsite backups, activating failover servers in a secondary data center, and meeting a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours to resume transactions.
        

---
#### 5. Incident Response Policy (IRP)

- **Definition**: A structured approach for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents (e.g., breaches, malware).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A tech company’s IRP is triggered when unusual network traffic indicates a potential data exfiltration. The policy guides the team to isolate infected systems, preserve logs for forensic analysis, notify affected customers under GDPR, and patch vulnerabilities to prevent recurrence.
        

---
#### 6. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Policy

- **Definition**: A framework for integrating security into every phase of software development (design, coding, testing, deployment).
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - A fintech startup’s SDLC policy mandates code reviews, static/dynamic analysis tools, and penetration testing before releasing a mobile banking app. This prevents vulnerabilities like SQL injection (listed in OWASP Top 10) from reaching production.
        

---
#### 7. Change Management Policy

- **Definition**: A process to ensure changes to IT systems (e.g., updates, patches) are tested, approved, and documented to minimize risks.
    
- **Example Use Case**:
    
    - An e-commerce platform uses a Change Management Policy to roll out a critical security patch. Changes are tested in a staging environment, approved by a Change Advisory Board (CAB), and deployed during off-peak hours with a rollback plan in case of failures.
