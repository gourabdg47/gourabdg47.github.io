I am following [Udemy Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/learn/lecture/40324620#overview)'s course for Security +

## Social Engineering  
**Manipulative** strategy that **exploits human psychology** to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or physical spaces.  
The backbone of these attacks lies in the attacker’s ability to **trick users into taking actions that compromise security**, often bypassing technical safeguards entirely.  

---

### Why Social Engineering Works  
Humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity. Attackers exploit cognitive biases, emotions, and social dynamics to manipulate victims. Understanding these tactics is critical for building resilience against such threats.  

---

#### Motivational Triggers  
Social engineers leverage psychological triggers to pressure targets into compliance. Here are the most common:  

1. **Familiarity & Likability**  
   Attackers mimic trusted individuals (colleagues, brands, or institutions) or use charm to build false trust.  

2. **Consensus & Social Proof**  
   “Everyone else is doing it” tactics create a false sense of safety in numbers, pressuring victims to act without scrutiny.  

3. **Authority & Intimidation**  
   Impersonating figures of authority (e.g., executives, law enforcement) or using threats to instill fear and urgency.  

4. **Scarcity & Urgency**  
   “Limited-time offers” or fabricated emergencies force rushed decisions, bypassing rational evaluation.  

---

#### Types of Social Engineering Attacks  
Attack vectors evolve constantly, but these are the most prevalent:  

1. **Phishing**  
   Fraudulent emails mimicking legitimate sources to steal credentials or deploy malware.  

2. **Vishing**  
   Voice calls (often spoofed numbers) pressuring victims to share sensitive information.  

3. **Smishing**  
   Malicious SMS/text messages containing links to phishing sites or malware.  

4. **Misinformation**  
   Spreading false narratives to manipulate public perception or behavior.  

5. **Disinformation**  
   Deliberately fabricated content to sow confusion, damage reputations, or incite panic.  

6. **Impersonation**  
   Posing as IT support, delivery personnel, or trusted contacts to gain physical or digital access.  

7. **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**  
   Spoofed corporate emails tricking employees into transferring funds or sensitive data.  

8. **Pretexting**  
   Fabricating scenarios (e.g., fake surveys, interviews) to extract personal or financial details.  

9. **Water-Holing**  
   Infecting websites frequented by target groups to distribute malware.  

10. **Brand Impersonation**  
    Mimicking trusted brands via fake websites, apps, or social media to harvest credentials.  

11. **Typosquatting**  
    Registering domains with subtle typos (e.g., “faceb00k.com”) to redirect victims to malicious sites.

### How to Protect Yourself  
- **Verify Requests**: Always confirm unusual or urgent requests via a separate communication channel.  
- **Think Before Clicking**: Hover over links to check URLs, and avoid opening attachments from unknown sources.  
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds a layer of defense against compromised credentials.  
- **Educate Teams**: Regular training and simulated phishing drills build organizational awareness.  

Social engineering thrives on human error. By recognizing red flags and fostering a culture of skepticism, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce their risk.

### Case Study: The "IT Support" Pretexting Attack  
**Scenario**: An attacker poses as a member of the company’s IT team, claiming to resolve a "critical system vulnerability." They pressure an employee to reveal their login credentials under the guise of urgent maintenance.  

---

#### Pretexting Call Example  
**Attacker**:  
*[Caller ID spoofed to display company’s internal number]*  
"Hi, this is Mark from IT Security. We’ve detected a severe security breach affecting your workstation. If we don’t patch it within the next 10 minutes, your files and the entire department’s data could be permanently lost. Are you at your desk right now?"  

**Employee**:  
"Oh no! Yes, I’m here. What do I need to do?"  

**Attacker**:  
"First, I need you to verify your identity for security purposes. What’s your employee ID?"  

**Employee**:  
"Sure, it’s 45823."  

**Attacker**:  
"Thanks. Now, open the security portal—it’s **security-portal.company[.]com**—and log in so I can push the patch remotely. Time is critical here."  

**Employee**:  
*[Enters credentials]*  
"Done. Is that all?"  

**Attacker**:  
"Almost. You’ll see a one-time code sent to your phone. Read it to me so I can finalize the update."  

**Employee**:  
"It’s 739501."  

**Attacker**:  
"Perfect. The patch is deploying now. Don’t touch your system for the next 20 minutes. Thanks for your cooperation!"  

---

### Why This Worked  
1. **Authority & Urgency**:  
   - The attacker invoked the IT department’s authority and fabricated a time-sensitive crisis to override skepticism.  

2. **Credibility**:  
   - Spoofed caller ID and use of plausible jargon ("security portal," "remote patch") added legitimacy.  

3. **Step-by-Step Manipulation**:  
   - Starting with a low-stakes request (employee ID) built compliance momentum for larger asks (credentials + MFA code).  

---

### Red Flags to Spot  
- **Unsolicited Contact**: Legitimate IT teams rarely demand credentials over the phone.  
- **Pressure to Bypass Protocols**: Urging you to ignore standard verification steps (e.g., submitting a support ticket).  
- **MFA Code Requests**: A one-time code should never be shared with anyone.  

**Always verify urgent requests in person or via a trusted channel**—not the one the caller provides.
