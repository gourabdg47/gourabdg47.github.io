Well I gave the exam CompTIA Security+ exam on 28th May 2025 2nd Try, 1st try was on 24th April 2025 and I passed. I scored **772 out of 900**.
Preparing for this exam was a hassle, maybe it's a beginner certificate but do not underestimate the studies and consistency needed to get into cybersecurity and *This is just the beginning of the journey*. <br>
After giving the exam and getting over with I was happy for a while but I am not satisfied yet. So will keep posting here on what I do next. I was thinking of doing the SC-200 SOC certificate, after give the exam twice and being jobless I am little short on cash and SC-200 seems cheaper. So will start with that along with TryHackMe (Free version). <br>
Anyways, congrats to me for not giving up, taking the leap of faith on switching career with my current situation. <br>
