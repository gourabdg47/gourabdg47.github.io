## What is a bothy?

Randomly, I was doing little exploring online about [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) in youtube and came across this video [Overnight Alone In A Scottish Island Bothy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW5J3qC4uVU) and I found it really interesting. Well, before everything else `What is Bothy ?`
According to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), it is a basic shelter which are unlocked and available to anyone for free of charge. They are mostly in the remote mountainous areas of Scotland. They are mostly used by hikers, travelers, birdwatchers or anyone want to enjoy off-grid for 1-2 days. I thinks its best to stay with one or more peoples since these are mostly places in most secluded areas but Scotland is generally considered a safe country. 
I do believe I want to have an experience like this. Watching the video, I got the vibe from a game called [DayZ](https://dayz.com/). This is a multiplayer survival zombie apocalyptic game. More then the zombies, I love the post-apocalyptic vibe. May be its a game but you can have some intense adventures in the game and I do love adventures preferably in IRL. Well game and all was fun during the school and collage times but now I feel I need to experience the real thing. The happiness, sadness, struggle, pain, sense of accomplishment, the thrill then are some real emotions a human needs to feel and experience to understand the universe more and understand self. Anyways, from Scotland to the universe I did travel a long distance in a very short time. 

## History of Scotland’s Bothies

These  `Huts` are often hours or days walk from roads or train lines. They usually lacking in electricity, running water, or even a toilet, but unlocked and free for any passing mountain-climber to use. 
So I think it will better if you read this blog [Tribune](https://tribunemag.co.uk/2022/06/bothy-scotland-trespass) written by [Tomás Ó Loingsigh](https://tribunemag.co.uk/author/tomas-o-loingsigh)


I know this topic is random but it's really interesting. Thinking places like these in populated countries like China or India, I doubt you'll ever come across a refuge that combines simplicity, history, and a deep connection to the land quite like a Scotland bothy. These rustic, unmanned shelters, tucked away in the wild Scottish Highlands, offer not only a place to rest but also an invitation to experience genuine camaraderie among travelers and an intimate glimpse into Scotland’s storied past. In a world dominated by modern comforts,  bothies remind us that sometimes the most profound experiences are found in the unadorned, humble corners of nature.
