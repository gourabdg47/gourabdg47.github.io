## Google cybersecurity cert

Been a while since I posted anything. So, I finished my [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity/) 2 days back. Here's my [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/P9264RVW05GN). This course is really detailed and for entry level (*<span style="color: yellow;">WARNING :</span>  Cybersecurity is not a entry-level career. You need the basic understanding of networking, OS, few frameworks, policies, etc*) cybersecurity career. This certification course have 8 components and each components have 4 sub-modules. Here are the component titles:

1. **Foundations of Cybersecurity :**  An introduction to key security concepts, terminology, and the overall cybersecurity landscape. This part covers basic principles such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability, setting the groundwork for understanding risk and defense strategies.  
	Keywords:_ cybersecurity fundamentals, CIA triad, risk management, basic security principles
2. **Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks :** Focuses on the methodologies and best practices for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks. Learners explore risk assessment frameworks and how to implement policies that protect information assets against potential threats.  
	Keywords:_ risk assessment, risk mitigation, security policies, threat management
3. **Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security :** Covers the essentials of network infrastructure and security. Topics include understanding network protocols, securing communications, deploying firewalls, and using intrusion detection systems to defend against unauthorized access.  
	Keywords:_ network security, firewalls, intrusion detection, VPN, secure protocols
4. **Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL :** Introduces the practical tools widely used in cybersecurity. This section emphasizes command-line proficiency in Linux and the use of SQL for querying and managing dataâ€”skills essential for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.  
	Keywords:_ Linux, SQL, command-line, scripting, data analysis
5. **Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities :** Examines how to identify and classify organizational assets, evaluate the landscape of potential threats, and perform vulnerability assessments. It teaches you how to prioritize risks and develop a strategic approach to protect critical assets.  
	Keywords:_ asset management, threat intelligence, vulnerability assessment, risk prioritization
6. **Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response :** Focuses on developing effective monitoring and incident response strategies. This module covers techniques for detecting breaches or anomalies, understanding alerts, and executing coordinated responses to mitigate incidents quickly.  
	Keywords:_ incident detection, SIEM, incident response, monitoring, cybersecurity alerts
7. **Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python :** Teaches how to use Python to automate repetitive cybersecurity tasks such as log parsing, scanning for vulnerabilities, and integrating with various security tools. This helps streamline security operations and improve efficiency.  
	Keywords:_ Python scripting, automation, cybersecurity tools, log analysis, vulnerability scanning
8. **Put It to Work: Prepare for Cybersecurity Jobs :** Prepares learners for the job market by focusing on practical application of skills. This part covers resume building, interview strategies, and hands-on projects that form a portfolio, bridging the gap between training and professional practice.  
	Keywords:_ career readiness, cybersecurity jobs, portfolio development, resume building, interview preparation

Well my main focus is CompTIA Security+ exam but the syllabus of Google cybersecurity and security+ overlaps a lot so this was definitely helpful + I now have a google certificate. This certificate is 6 month course but totally doable in 2 months like I did. 

My next posts, will be on the topics I study for Security+ exam. So Stay Tuned ...
