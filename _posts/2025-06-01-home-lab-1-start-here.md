## Cyber Security Virtual Lab
After passing my security+ exam, now I am planning to doing a home lab setup but mostly using virtual machine and not like real hardware (Too costly).
For this home lab setup, I am following this [  
LS111 Cyber Security Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3CZyu6WD7I&list=PLjjkJroii8DDb0QZpWLo978VXcLp8-xW3&index=2) tutorial on YouTube. 

In this lab, we will get skills & experience like :
* Hands on networking skills 
* Hands on system administration skills
* Virtualization configuration experience
* Pentesting skills
* System/Device Hardening
* Safe and controlled environment
Since this tutorial is 3 years old, I might face lots of problems, errors but hopefully I will be able to finish through all the setups, configurations, and challenges 

### The Scenario

Contracted to Morgan Maxwell Real Estate to overhaul their IT infrastructure and systems.
· Currently have 50 staff connected to a workgroup network, no central file shares or storage, no backups, no monitoring or AV, no user management.
. Mr Maxwell, the Principle Agent, has become concerned about this and has requested that we centralize IT resources,  data and user management, so he has better control of his resources.
. He is also concerned about cybersecurity and has read a lot about Ransomware, and wants us to harden, monitor, and defend
his network.
