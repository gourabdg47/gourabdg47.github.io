## What is CIS Critical Security Controls
TheÂ **CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls)**Â are a prioritized set of best practices designed to mitigate the most common cyber threats. Developed by the **Center for Internet Security** (CIS), they provide a streamlined approach to cybersecurity, updated to address modern challenges like cloud environments and supply chain risks.

Divided intoÂ **Implementation Groups (IGs)**Â to prioritize actions based on organizational resources and risk profiles:

- **IG1**: Foundational cyber hygiene for small/mid-sized organizations.
- **IG2**: Enhanced protections for organizations with sensitive data.
- **IG3**: Advanced defenses for enterprises facing sophisticated threats

Â > *Reduces attack surfaces, supports compliance, and improves incident response*

#### **The 18 CIS Critical Security Controls**

1. **Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets**  
    Actively track all hardware (servers, IoT devices, mobile endpoints) to identify unauthorized assets and enforce monitoringÂ .
    
2. **Inventory and Control of Software Assets**  
    Manage authorized software to prevent unauthorized installations, using allow lists and automated toolsÂ .
    
3. **Data Protection**  
    Classify, encrypt (in transit/at rest), and monitor sensitive data. Includes data loss prevention (DLP) and secure disposalÂ .
    
4. **Secure Configuration of Assets and Software**  
    Replace default settings with hardened configurations (e.g., firewalls, session timeouts) to minimize vulnerabilitiesÂ .
    
5. **Account Management**  
    Govern credentials for user/admin/service accounts, enforce password policies, and disable dormant accountsÂ .
    
6. **Access Control Management**  
    Apply least-privilege principles, use multi-factor authentication (MFA), and centralize access via SSOÂ .
    
7. **Continuous Vulnerability Management**  
    Regularly scan for and remediate vulnerabilities using automated tools and threat intelligenceÂ .
    
8. **Audit Log Management**  
    Collect and analyze logs to detect anomalies and support incident investigations.
    
9. **Email and Web Browser Protections**  
    Block malicious URLs/attachments and train users to recognize phishing.
    
10. **Malware Defenses**  
    Deploy anti-malware tools with automated updates and behavior-based detection.
    
11. **Data Recovery**  
    Maintain automated backups, test restoration processes, and isolate backup data to counter ransomwareÂ .
    
12. **Network Infrastructure Management**  
    Secure network devices (routers, switches) and enforce traffic filteringÂ .
    
13. **Network Monitoring and Defense**  
    Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) and traffic analysis to identify threatsÂ .
    
14. **Security Awareness Training**  
    Educate employees on social engineering, secure authentication, and incident reportingÂ .
    
15. **Service Provider Management**  
    Vet third-party vendors handling sensitive data and include security clauses in contracts.
    
16. **Application Software Security**  
    Integrate security into the software lifecycle (e.g., code reviews, patching).
    
17. **Incident Response Management**  
    Develop playbooks, conduct drills, and define roles for rapid threat containment.
    
18. **Penetration Testing**  
    Simulate attacks to identify gaps in people, processes, and technology

> *The CIS Controls map to major frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, PCI DSS) and help meet regulations like GDPR and HIPAA*
