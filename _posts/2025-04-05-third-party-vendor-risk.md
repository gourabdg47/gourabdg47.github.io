I am following [Jason Dion's Security+ course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/learn/lecture/40324620#overview) to prepare for the CompTIA Security+ certification.

## Third Party Vendor Risk
Potential **security risk** and **challenges** introduced by external entities e.g. *Vendors, Suppliers and Service providers*

#### Supply Chain Risk
##### Points
1. **Hardware Manufactures**: Conduct rigorous supply chain assessments
2. **Software Developers**: Ensure it's properly licensed, it's authenticate, free of known vulnerabilities or bugs  
3. **Managed Service Providers** (MSP): Organizations that provide a ranged of technology service and supports to business and other clients 
	Questions to ask ?
	
	- Evaluate data security measures when we entrust our service providers to access our data
	- How can we ensure that the information they are getting actually maintains confidentiality & integrity ?
	- Are the managed service providers following cybersecurity protocols robust enough to protect all my data ?
	- In face of a security breach, would the service providers be well equipped to provide the necessary support & cooperation that I might need to conduct a full scale incident response or forensic investigation?  
	 
#### Supply Chain Attacks
Attack that involves targeting the weaker link in the supply-chain to gain access to the primary target
##### How to avoid these attacks ?
1. **Vendor Due Diligence**: Understanding there cybersecurity posture & also there supply chain management (_Supply Chain Analysis_) & security practices 
2. **Regular Monitoring & Auditing**
3. **Education & collaboration**: Broader Ecosystem
4. **Incorporating Contractual Safeguards**

#### Vendor Assessments
Process that organizations implement to evaluate the security, reliability and performance of external entities
- **Vendors**: Provides goods to an organization
- **Suppliers**: Production or Delivery of products or parts of products
- **MSP**: Provides services e.g. IT Service. Should have right to audit clause should be included inside the contract

#### Vendor Selection & Monitoring
- Vendor Assessment
- Contract Review
- Penetration Testing 
- Internal & External Audits
##### Basic Concepts 
Basic Concepts of vendor selection 
1. **Due Diligence**: 
	- *Financial Stability*
	- *Operational History*
	- *Client Testimonies*
	- *On-The-Ground Practices* 
	- *Conflict of Interest*

2. **Vendor Questionaries**
	Comprehensive Documents that potential vendors fill out to offer insights into the **operations**, **capabilities** & **compliance**
	- *Data Redundancy Measures* 
	- *Security Protocols* 
	- *Uptime Guarantees* 
	- *Disaster Recovery Plans*
	
**Rules Of Engagement**: Guidelines that dictates the guidelines between an organization and it's potential vendors 
- Communication Protocols 
- Data sharing policies
- Negotiation Boundaries 
##### Monitoring 
Mechanism to unsure the chosen vendor still aligns with the organizational needs & standards 
- *Performance Reviews*
- *Feedback Loops*
#### Contracts & Agreements
**Types**
1. **Basic Contract**  
	_Explanation_: A straightforward agreement outlining terms between parties (e.g., payment, deliverables, timelines). Legally binding but less detailed than specialized contracts.  
	_Case Study_: A freelance graphic designer signs a contract with a client to create a logo for $1,000, specifying deadlines and ownership rights.

2. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**  
	_Explanation_: Defines service quality metrics (e.g., uptime, response time) between a provider and client.  
	_Case Study_: A cloud hosting company guarantees 99.9% uptime in its SLA with an e-commerce business, with penalties for downtime exceeding 0.1%.

3. **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)**  
	_Explanation_: Formalizes collaboration between organizations, detailing roles and responsibilities.  
	_Case Study_: A city government and a nonprofit sign an MOA to jointly fund and manage a public park renovation, outlining cost-sharing and maintenance duties.

4. **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)**  
	_Explanation_: Non-binding agreement expressing intent to collaborate, often a precursor to formal contracts.  
	_Case Study_: Two tech startups sign an MOU to explore integrating their software platforms, with no financial commitments yet.

5. **Master Service Agreement (MSA)**  
	_Explanation_: Governs long-term relationships, setting terms for future projects or transactions.  
	_Case Study_: A marketing agency signs an MSA with a corporate client, streamlining terms for recurring campaigns over three years.

6. **Statement of Work (SOW)**  
	_Explanation_: Specifies project scope, tasks, and deliverables, often under an MSA.  
	_Case Study_: Under an MSA, a construction firm drafts an SOW to build a warehouse, detailing materials, labor, and a 12-month timeline.

7. **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**  
	_Explanation_: Legally binds parties to confidentiality, protecting sensitive information.  
	_Case Study_: A biotech startup requires investors to sign an NDA before sharing details of a patented drug formula.

8. **Business Partnership Agreement (BPA)**  
	_Explanation_: Outlines profit-sharing, roles, and dispute resolution for business partners.  
	_Case Study_: Two entrepreneurs launch a cafÃ©, signing a BPA that allocates 60/40 profits and defines managerial responsibilities.
