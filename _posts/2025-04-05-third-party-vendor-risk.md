I am following [Jason Dion's Security+ course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/learn/lecture/40324620#overview) to prepare for the CompTIA Security+ certification.

## Third Party Vendor Risk

Potential **security risks** and **challenges** introduced by external entities, e.g., _vendors, suppliers, and service providers_.

---

### Supply Chain Risk

#### Key Points:

1. **Hardware Manufacturers**: Conduct rigorous supply chain assessments.
    
2. **Software Developers**: Ensure software is properly licensed, authentic, and free of known vulnerabilities or bugs.
    
3. **Managed Service Providers (MSP)**: Organizations that provide a range of technology services and support to businesses and clients.
    

**Questions to Ask?**

- Evaluate data security measures when entrusting service providers with access to your data.
    
- How can we ensure the information they handle maintains confidentiality and integrity?
    
- Are MSPs following cybersecurity protocols robust enough to protect your data?
    
- In the event of a security breach, will MSPs provide necessary support for incident response or forensic investigations?

### Supply Chain Attacks

Attacks targeting weaker links in the supply chain to gain access to the primary target.

#### How to Avoid These Attacks?

1. **Vendor Due Diligence**: Understand their cybersecurity posture, supply chain management, and security practices (_Supply Chain Analysis_).
    
2. **Regular Monitoring & Auditing**
    
3. **Education & Collaboration**: Engage the broader ecosystem.
    
4. **Incorporating Contractual Safeguards**

### Vendor Assessments

A process organizations use to evaluate the security, reliability, and performance of external entities.

- **Vendors**: Provide goods to an organization.
    
- **Suppliers**: Handle production or delivery of products/parts.
    
- **MSPs**: Provide services (e.g., IT). Contracts should include a _right-to-audit_ clause.

### Vendor Selection & Monitoring

- Vendor Assessment
- Contract Review
- Penetration Testing
- Internal & External Audits
    
#### Basic Concepts of Vendor Selection

1. **Due Diligence**:
    
    - _Financial Stability_
    - _Operational History_
    - _Client Testimonies_
    - _On-The-Ground Practices_
    - _Conflict of Interest_
        
2. **Vendor Questionnaires**:  
    Comprehensive documents filled by potential vendors to provide insights into **operations**, **capabilities**, and **compliance**:
    
    - _Data Redundancy Measures_
    - _Security Protocols_
    - _Uptime Guarantees_
    - _Disaster Recovery Plans_
        

**Rules of Engagement**: Guidelines dictating interactions between an organization and potential vendors:

- Communication Protocols
- Data Sharing Policies
- Negotiation Boundaries
    
#### Monitoring

Mechanisms to ensure vendors align with organizational needs and standards:

- _Performance Reviews_
- _Feedback Loops_

### Contracts & Agreements

#### Types

1. **Basic Contract**  
    _Explanation_: A straightforward agreement outlining terms (e.g., payment, deliverables, timelines). Legally binding but less detailed.  
    _Case Study_: A freelance designer signs a contract with a client to create a logo for $1,000, with deadlines and ownership rights.
    
2. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**  
    _Explanation_: Defines service quality metrics (e.g., uptime, response time).  
    _Case Study_: A cloud provider guarantees 99.9% uptime in an SLA with penalties for downtime exceeding 0.1%.
    
3. **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)**  
    _Explanation_: Formalizes collaboration between organizations, detailing roles/responsibilities.  
    _Case Study_: A city government and nonprofit sign an MOA to fund a park renovation.
    
4. **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)**  
    _Explanation_: Non-binding agreement expressing intent to collaborate.  
    _Case Study_: Two startups sign an MOU to explore software integration.
    
5. **Master Service Agreement (MSA)**  
    _Explanation_: Governs long-term relationships for future projects.  
    _Case Study_: A marketing agency signs an MSA for recurring campaigns over three years.
    
6. **Statement of Work (SOW)**  
    _Explanation_: Specifies project scope, tasks, and deliverables (often under an MSA).  
    _Case Study_: A construction firm drafts an SOW to build a warehouse with a 12-month timeline.
    
7. **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**  
    _Explanation_: Legally binds parties to confidentiality.  
    _Case Study_: A biotech startup requires NDAs for investors reviewing a patented drug formula.
    
8. **Business Partnership Agreement (BPA)**  
    _Explanation_: Outlines profit-sharing, roles, and dispute resolution.  
    _Case Study_: Two entrepreneurs launch a café with a BPA allocating 60/40 profits and managerial duties.
