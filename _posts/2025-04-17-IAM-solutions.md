## **1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)**

**What It Is**:  
IAM governsÂ _who_Â (users, devices) can accessÂ _what_Â (resources) andÂ _how_Â (permissions).

**Key Components**:

- **Identity Provisioning**: Creating user accounts (e.g., onboarding employees in Active Directory).
    
- **Authentication**: Verifying identities (e.g., passwords, biometrics).
    
- **Authorization**: Granting permissions (e.g., read/write access to files).
    
- **Auditing**: Tracking access (e.g., logging login attempts).
    

**Example**:  
A hospital uses IAM to ensure doctors access patient records (authorization) only after logging in with their ID badge (authentication).

**Exam Tip**: Know the difference betweenÂ **authentication**Â (proving identity) andÂ **authorization**Â (granting permissions).

## **2. Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**

**What It Is**:  
RequiringÂ **two or more**Â authentication factors:

1. **Something you know**Â (password).
    
2. **Something you have**Â (smartphone, token).
    
3. **Something you are**Â (fingerprint, facial recognition).
    

**Example**:  
Google Authenticator generates a time-based one-time password (TOTP) for logging into your bank account.

**Security+ Focus**:

- **MFA Types**: SMS (less secure), hardware tokens (YubiKey), biometrics.
    
- **MFA Bypass Risks**: SIM swapping, phishing attacks (e.g., fake MFA prompts).
    

---

## **3. Password Security**

**Best Practices**:

- **Complexity**:Â `Pa$$w0rd!`Â >Â `password123`.
    
- **Length**: 12+ characters.
    
- **Rotation**: Change every 90 days (though NIST now recommendsÂ _longer passwords over frequent changes_).
    
- **Storage**: Use a password manager (e.g., LastPass, ***Bitwarden***).
    

**Example**:  
A company enforcesÂ **password history policies**Â to prevent reusing old passwords.

**Exam Alert**:

- **Password Policies**: CompTIA loves questions onÂ **password expiration**,Â **reuse**, andÂ **complexity rules**.
    

---

## **4. Password Attacks**

**Common Types**:

- **Brute Force**: Trying every possible combination (e.g.,Â `hydra`Â tool).
    
- **Dictionary Attack**: Using common words (e.g.,Â `rockyou.txt`Â wordlist).
    
- **Rainbow Table**: Precomputed hashes for cracking passwords.
    
- **Credential Stuffing**: Reusing breached passwords across sites.
    

**Real-World Example**:  
TheÂ **2012 LinkedIn breach**Â exposed 117 million passwords stored as unsalted SHA-1 hashes, enabling easy cracking.

**Mitigation**:

- **Salting**: Adding random data to passwords before hashing.
    
- **Account Lockouts**: Lock after 5 failed attempts.

## **5. Single Sign-On (SSO)**

**What It Is**:  
One login grants access to multiple systems (e.g., logging into Google to access Gmail, Drive, and YouTube).

**How It Works**:

- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Centralizes authentication (e.g., Okta, Microsoft Entra ID).
    
- **Service Provider (SP)**: Relies on the IdP (e.g., Salesforce, Slack).
    

**Example**:  
Employees at a tech company use SSO to access GitHub, Jira, and Confluence without separate logins.

**Security+ Focus**:

- **Advantages**: Reduces password fatigue.
    
- **Risks**: SSO as a single point of failure (if compromised).

## **6. Federation**

**What It Is**:  
Extending SSO across organizations usingÂ **trusted standards**:

- **SAML**Â (Security Assertion Markup Language): XML-based for web apps.
    
- **OAuth 2.0**Â (Open Authorization): Token-based API access (e.g., "Sign in with Google").
    
- **OpenID Connect**: Built on OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
    

**Example**:  
A university partners with a research lab. Students log in via their university credentials (SAML) to access the labâ€™s portal.

**Exam Tip**:

- **SAML**Â = Authentication + Authorization.
    
- **OAuth**Â = Authorization only.

## **7. Privileged Access Management (PAM)**

**What It Is**:  
Securing accounts with elevated permissions (e.g., admins, root users).

**Key Strategies**:

- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Access**: Temporary privileges (e.g., CyberArk).
    
- **Session Monitoring**: Record and audit admin activities.
    
- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**: Grant minimal permissions needed.
    

**Example**:  
A sysadmin usesÂ **PAM tools**Â like Thycotic to access a server, with automatic session termination after 1 hour.

**Exam Focus**:

- **Privilege Escalation**: Mitigated by PAM (e.g., vertical vs. horizontal).

## **8. Access Control Models**

**Common Models**:

1. **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)**: Owners control access (e.g., file permissions in Windows).
    
2. **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)**: System-enforced labels (e.g., military classified data).
    
3. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Permissions based on job roles (e.g., "HR Manager").
    
4. **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: Rules based on attributes (e.g., time, location).
    

**Example**:  
A hospital usesÂ **RBAC**Â to grant nurses access to patient records but restricts editing to doctors.

**Security+ Tip**:

- **Rule-Based Access Control**Â â‰  RBAC. Rule-based usesÂ _system-wide rules_Â (e.g., firewall ACLs).
    

---

## **9. Assigning Permissions**

**Best Practices**:

- **Role-Based**: Assign permissions to groups, not individuals (e.g., "Finance Team").
    
- **User Access Reviews**: Audit permissions quarterly.
    
- **Separation of Duties**: Prevent conflicts of interest (e.g., same person canâ€™t approve and process payments).
    

**Example**:  
A cloud admin usesÂ **AWS IAM roles**Â to grant EC2 instances access to S3 buckets without hardcoding keys.

## **10. Review: Key IAM Concepts for Security+**

**Must-Know Checklist**:  
âœ…Â **MFA**Â reduces account takeover risks.  
âœ…Â **SSO**Â relies on federation standards (SAML, OAuth).  
âœ…Â **PAM**Â secures admin accounts via JIT and monitoring.  
âœ…Â **RBAC**Â > DAC for enterprise scalability.

**Exam Practice Question**:  
_Which access control model uses labels like "Top Secret" and "Confidential"?_  
A) DAC  
B) MAC  
C) RBAC  
D) ABAC  
**Answer**: B) MAC.

## **Final Tips for Security+ Success**

- **Hands-On Practice**: Set up SSO with free tiers (e.g., Azure AD).
- **Memorize Standards**: SAML vs. OAuth, RBAC vs. ABAC.
- **Think Like an Auditor**: How would you detect unauthorized access?
    
**FAQ**:  
**Q**: Whatâ€™s the difference between SSO and Federation?  
**A**: SSO is for one organization; Federation extends SSO acrossÂ _multiple_Â organizations.

**Q**: How does salting prevent rainbow table attacks?  
**A**: Salting adds unique random data to each password, making precomputed tables useless.
